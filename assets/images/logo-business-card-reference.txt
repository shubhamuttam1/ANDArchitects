LOGO EXTRACTION NEEDED

The new logo needs to be extracted from the business card image:
- Source: assets/images/business-card.jpeg
- Logo text: "AnD Architects" 
- Design: Clean typography with red accent element
- Location: Top portion of business card

To complete the logo update:
1. Extract/crop the "AnD Architects" logo from the business card
2. Save as: assets/images/logo.png
3. Ensure transparent background for web use
4. Optimize size for web display

The current logo.png will be replaced with the extracted business card logo.
